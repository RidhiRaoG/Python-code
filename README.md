3)This story is a bit like our drunken pirate described above... except nobody is going to fall into the harbor. It concerns an artist named Egon.

Egon is a painter and a poet. He lives in the beautiful town of Monte Carlo by the sea. In the center of this town is the town square, a large flat brick plaza. Egon wishes to paint something on the town square but he does not know what... until one day he finds a discarded dice. He discovers that when he rolls it the top face comes up either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. But he finds that he cannot reliably predict what that number will be. This gives him an idea for a painting.

Early one morning Egon sets three empty paint cans A, B and C on the ground to make a huge triangle in the town square
He walks to some random location on the town square where he can see his three paint cans forming the corners of a large triangle, 137 feet to each side
The 137 feet is not important here; it is just for our amusement
Egon rolls his dice.
On a 1 or a 2 he walks half way to paint can A
On a 3 or a 4 he walks half way to paint can B
On a 5 or a 6 he walks half way to paint can C
He then paints a dot on the ground at his feet
From that new spot: Egon repeats the process:
He rolls the dice
He uses the same method to select a destination paint can
He walks half way to that paint can
He paints a dot
If Egon repeats the process 17 times he will have 17 dots. But he does not stop at 17. He keeps on going and going and going, rolling, walking half way, painting a dot, until the sun goes down. Here is the challenge in two parts:

What do you suppose the resulting painting looks like?

Can you write a computer program to simulate Egon's painting?
